# BadescInternalForm

A contact form I made for an internal BADESC website, made with HTML, CSS, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), JavaScript and PHP, was used in the [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer) library for sending the form by email.

* To test you can use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/index.html), put the project in the folder '\xampp\htdocs'.

* Run XAMPP and start in Apache.

* Now open the browser and go to 'localhost/BadescInternalForm'.
